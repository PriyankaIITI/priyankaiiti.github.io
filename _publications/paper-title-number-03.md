excerpt: 'This paper proposes a novel feature-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to regenerate occluded traffic signs to improve detection accuracy. The GAN-generated features are fused with the Faster R-CNN-generated features. The architecture of GAN is tiny and integrated at the feature level within Faster R-CNN to minimize computational overhead.'
