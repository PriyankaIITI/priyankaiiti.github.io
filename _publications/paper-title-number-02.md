excerpt: 'This paper addresses the challenge of recognizing traffic signs in poor visibility under varying light conditions. It employs a two-step approach: find the lighting quality of image and then based on that quality enhance image if quality lies below some threshold. Then employ YOLOv8 to detect the traffic signs.'
